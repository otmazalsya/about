# Welcome to Memo ðŸ‘‹

19/12/2019

This is so exciting.
Thank you for checking out memo!

Memo has no bold, italic or subtitles, minimal and plain. Great for really focusing and creating your own formatting. It's totally free, and uses private Github Gists as cloud storage.

Let me tell you about how memo works;
	- There are separated paragraphs
	- A double new line creates a paragraph
	- Every paragraph has its own insights âœ¨
	- Enable which insights you want in addons ðŸ§©
	- Use offline, push your changes to cloud later

Now, archive or remove this sheet or create a new sheet from sidebar sheets tab and start taking notes.

Also if you see any bug, let's crush it together on GitHub!
